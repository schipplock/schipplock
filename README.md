# Hi, I'm `Andreas Schipplock` ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer in the Ruhr area of NRW, Germany. I'm interested in writing usable and good software. I'm not interested in overly complex software.

I tend to delete my projects from Github because I don't have use for them anymore. As a result, you will only find a small selection here. Software that I use myself.

Let's be realistic. I write most of the software for my employer, which I can't publish here for obvious reasons.
